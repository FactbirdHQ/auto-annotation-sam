TODO:
[X] test Data loader + K-fold
[X] test Models
[X] test Report Generator
[ ] Improve Report Generator:
    - F1 score visualization: 1 large average and one small for each of the other 4
    - Training size analysis: One plot pr. model with 1 line for each dataset and an average. Also it should include the max parformance?
    - Computational Performance: add the other scatter with training time Performance.
    - Model Consistency Analysis: Maybe we just delete Ranking correlation between datasets, it seems useless. SAme with Rank distribution.
    - Delete conclusion
[X] Implement a second track mode in data loader
[ ] Implement safeguard for training size analysis not to train on images without class examples (maybe even max them out)
[ ] Fix study run order

TODO:
[X] test Data loader + K-fold
[X] test Models
[X] test Report Generator
[X] Improve Report Generator:
    [X] F1 score visualization: 1 large average plot and one small plot for each of the datasets
    [X] Training size analysis: One plot pr. model with 1 line for each dataset and an average. Also it should include the max parformance, i.e. training on full folds from the other data.
    [X] Computational Performance: add the other scatter with training time Performance.
    [X] Model Consistency Analysis: Maybe we just delete Ranking correlation between datasets.
    [X] Delete conclusion
    [X] Add Track 2 analysis, what part is SAMs fault.
[X] Implement a second track mode in data loader
[X] Implement safeguard for training size analysis not to train on images without class examples (maybe even max them out)
[X] Double check model hyperparameters (like lasso for LogReg)
[X] Fix study run order
    [X] Second track
